### React, React Router, Style Component
This application was built using [React](https://react.dev/). The two most important dependencies for this project are [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for handling routing and styled-components for styling. [Style Component](https://styled-components.com/) allow scoping the styles to the same file where the component is located.

### App Architecture
The following image was used as inspiration:

Replicating as closely as possible, pixel perfect, to adapt to the needs of the new website.

The website's CSS styles were meticulously crafted from scratch, without any reliance on external code. Similarly to JSX, no pre-existing code was copied.

The application is completely responsive.
