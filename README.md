### React, React Router, Style Component
This application was created with [React](https://react.dev/).

Scope to the same file where the component to style is located.

### App Architecture
The following image was used as inspiration:

![Antique collection website](https://github.com/dgsergio/hardware-store-static/raw/master/public/img/inspiration.jpg)

Trying to copy as reliable as possible, adapting to the new e-commerce orientation.

The CSS style of the website was completely coded by hand. Just like JSX, no external code was copied.

The application is completely responsive.
